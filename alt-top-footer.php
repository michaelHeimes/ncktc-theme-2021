			<h4>More than just a piece of paper</h4>
			<p>"I was attracted to this college because I had heard great feedback about the teachers and the excellent programs. I was informed about the job placement and the graduation rate when I applied a few years ago. I love being apart of this school, I am a student ambassador and part of student senate. Everyone I have been involved with truly cares about each student and wants to see them succeed. I plan on using my business and marketing degree together to run a successful business."</p>

			<h4>Technically <br>Speaking</h4>
			<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 65% of jobs in today’s workforce are classified as ‘skilled and technical.’ Jobs in this category require training beyond high school but do not necessarily require a four-year degree.</p>
			<p>That’s where North Central Kansas Technical College can serve as part of the solution for employers and for individuals seeking to work in these high-skill, high-tech, high-wage fields. So technically speaking, the training for technical fields are in high demand, taught hands-on, can be completed in 9-18 months, require less student debt, and result in high wages and opportunities for advancement.</p>
